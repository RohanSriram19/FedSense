## 📈 Demo Results (Expected)

Based on similar federated learning systems:

| Metric | Local Baseline | Federated (8 clients) | Federated + DP |
|--------|----------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Accuracy | 94.5% | 93.8% | 92.3% |
| Precision | 91.2% | 90.5% | 88.7% |
| Recall | 87.8% | 87.1% | 85.2% |
| F1-Score | 89.5% | 88.7% | 86.9% |
| AUC-ROC | 96.2% | 95.8% | 94.1% |

*Performance degradation with federation is minimal (<1%), and DP adds ~2-3% cost for privacy*
